The file QAOA_SVP.py provides the general framework for simulating the SVP Hamiltonian using the standard QAOA ansatz with the SWAP gate algorithm for a 1D geometry. 
This file can be used for any qubit count.

The file Modified_QAOA_12q.py is an extension of the general framework to include the determined driver Hamiltonian coefficients.
This file is written specifically for 12 qubit systems.

Both files are written to run immediately upon download for example lattices.
